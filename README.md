Transaction Fraud Detection! 
During my CodSoft internship, I worked on a challenging project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Here's a glimpse of what I did:
Project Context: Developed an efficient system to spot fraudulent transactions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovered hidden patterns and correlations in the dataset.
Data Modeling and Prediction: Preprocessed the data, used SMOTE to address class imbalance, and built a Logistic Regression Model for fraud detection.
Model Evaluation: Rigorously trained and fine-tuned the model, ensuring its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions.
